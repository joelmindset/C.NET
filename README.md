# C.NET
  Here I will be learning basic C-Sharp, .net framework, core, entity, and much more. I enjoyed using .Net / .Netcore. I found it really easy to use in VS and easy to understand.  The MVC design really came to life for me in C. The power behind making a website and connecting to the database was amazing. 

Writing in C really helped me as a developer. Before I was always trying to brute force my code. While I was learning C, I learned that brute force wasn't going to work, it was draining my full potential, and enjoyment.  After some online research I found this is a common problem for devs. I learned techniques on how to take your code step by step and how to overcome the brute force trap. C sharp helped me understand this was a problem and needed to be quickly resolved. This understanding was the best moment Iâ€™ve ever had coding. I know the issue is just figuring out the next step, understanding it, applying it to my code, and making sure it works. Instead of looking at the entire problem and feeling deterred, I am so excited to tackle that first step. I know I can figure it out step by step. How I came to this understanding, it has to do with compiling your code and having no syntax errors. Now I can work forever happily, without getting deterred. Well enough about that moment let's get to the code.
